We are listing a position for Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Psychiatry at UC San Diego, to begin as soon as possible. Being on-location in San Diego is preferred but not required. In addition, start date may occur prior to relocation to San Diego.

This position is ideal for a candidate seeking an academic research career and especially who may wish to seek a faculty position at UCSD after completion of the fellowship.

**The fellow will be funded on two research projects funded by NIDA and NIAAA, both focused on adolescents.** The first project investigates the role of family processes (e.g., parenting, conflict) in the etiology of drinking, drug use, conduct problems, and delinquency across adolescence. The second project focuses on how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected adolescent drinking and drug use patterns.

**Both projects comprise secondary data analysis of the ongoing Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study** a national multisite consortium following nearly 12,000 children prospectively from late childhood to young adulthood (<https://abcdstudy.org/>).

**The fellow’s primary responsibilities will be writing manuscripts and conducting statistical analyses.** The fellow is expected to be a co-author on all manuscripts resulting from the two research projects and to lead their own papers that are consistent with the broader set of Scientific Aims and their own interests. The fellow will not have any duties pertaining to primary data collection (i.e., running participants). The data to be analyzed has already been cleaned by ABCD Study Consortium staff prior to public release. The fellow will not have data management responsibilities beyond restructuring data as necessary for their analyses.

Thus, this position is ideal for someone hoping to increase their publication record during postdoc. We anticipate between 4-8 publications per year arising from these activities.

Work will be conducted under the primary supervision of Dr. William Pelham, PhD, Assistant Professor of Psychiatry. [Dr. Susan Tapert](https://profiles.ucsd.edu/susan.tapert) will serve as a secondary, senior faculty mentor to the fellow. On-site, senior co-investigators on both research projects include nationally renowned experts in adolescent substance use (Dr. Sandy Brown, PhD; Dr. Susan Tapert, PhD).

**The fellow will have access to several training opportunities at UCSD and through the ABCD Study Consortium.** UCSD is among the top psychiatry departments in the U.S. in terms of research funding, has more than 200 faculty members including national experts in many domains, and devotes extensive resources to postdoctoral training. The fellow may attend UCSD's biweekly Addiction Seminar, hosted by a NIAAA-funded T32 training program in alcohol research; participate in an annual Psychiatry Grant Writing Seminar and/or career development award (K) writing group; and attend speaker series through Psychiatry Grand Rounds and the Center for Human Development. Through participation in the ABCD Study Consortium, the fellow may gain exposure to senior investigators at 22 study sites across the U.S. and have access to feedback from groups of both domain-matter and biostatistical experts.

The fellow’s participation in grant writing is optional but encouraged. Pathways to a faculty position at UCSD are available for fellows who secure external funding. The School of Medicine has an exceptional track record of mentoring postdoctoral fellows into funded faculty positions. For example, more than 20 faculty members at UCSD hold active research career development (K) awards from NIDA/NIAAA.

UC San Diego is considered an exempt setting by the [California Board of Psychology](<https://www.psychology.ca.gov/applicants/index.shtml>). Completion of supervised clinical research as part of this fellowship may count toward supervised professional experience (SPE) hours for clinical licensure in the State of California.

The position includes a [generous benefits package](https://postdoc.ucsd.edu/postdocs/benefits-services.html) (medical, dental, vision).
